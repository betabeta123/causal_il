# Enhancing Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Imitation Learning via Intervention-Based Counterfactuals

The aim of this project is to improve the out-of-distribution generalization performance of imitation learning, avoiding the accumulation of errors by the agent due to poor generalization performance when encountering unfamiliar scenarios.
